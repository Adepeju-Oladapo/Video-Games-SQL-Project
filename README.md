# Video-Games-SQL-Project
This notebook contains the code implemented for my capstone project for the Data analyst in SQL career track with Datacamp
In this project, I explored over 13000 best-selling video games created between 1977 and 2020 with SQL. I compared a dataset on game sales with critic and user reviews to determine whether or not video games have improved as the gaming market has grown.
I wrote SQL queries to extract and filter data based on specific criteria and made use of JOIN statements to combine related data based on shared columns.
The goal of this project was to determine the best performing years for video games.
